First, let me say that I'm not a fan of boxing. In fact, I pretty much hate the sport. Honestly, who likes seeing people getting their head beat in every day?

With that being said, this series is brilliantly done. There's comedy, romance, and plenty, plenty, plenty of plot. Follow Ippo as he grows as a person and as a professional boxer. You'll laugh, and you'll probably cry here or there. The fact that I don't even like boxing never came in to play. You'll probably find yourself doing some jabs here and there while watching the show too. It's that captivating.

The supporting characters are awesome. Takamura, Kimura and Aoki are all equally hilarious. Each has a distinct personality that make them all very lovable. They also support Ippo as he meets his trials of boxing and life.

Definitely give this series a try. You won't be disappointed with the 76 episodes. In fact, you'll probably end up reading the manga because you don't want it to stop!
